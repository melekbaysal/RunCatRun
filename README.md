# RunCatRun🐈🎮
with Kaan Çakal(https://github.com/elcrosG)

We had to develop a social responsibility project for the ART265 course. It was made in 3 days using Unity game engine and free assets for 3D models.

If a player scores 50 points in the game, a certain amount of cat food is dispensed into an automatic feeding station, which is assumed to be located on the streets. To replicate this process, we created a prototype of the feeding station using Arduino Uno and other necessary electronic components.

You can find an video showing both the game and the feeding station in operation at the same time by following the link below.
